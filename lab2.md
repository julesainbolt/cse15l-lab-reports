# Servers and SSH Keys

## Part 1 


## Part 2


## Part 3

In week 2, I learned how to connect to a remote computer or server over the internet
using the *ssh* command. I also learned how to make a simple search engine by 
implementing a web server that tracks a list of strings. 

In week 3, I learned how to securely transfer data over from the local host 
to the remote host by using the *scp* command.
