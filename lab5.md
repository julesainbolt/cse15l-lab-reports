# Lab Report 5 - Putting It All Together 

## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

Student:

![bug symptom](bug%20symptom.png)

I keep getting this error message and I don't know how to resolve it. 
The output from running the tests says `ListExamples.merge(ListExamples.java:44)`.
I think the bug could be somewhere in the method `merge` in one 
of the while loops. What do you think? 

TA: 

You're off to a good start! Look inside
